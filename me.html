		<h2>Entrepreneur, Sports Enthusiast, Aspiring Web Designer</h2>
			<p>After graduating from Hope College with a degree in Business Management, I was given the opportunity to play professional football in Germany for the summer. During my time overseas, I discovered a passion for travel and adventure. I was fortunate enough to get to a number of different countries and cities before returning home in October. Upon my return, I went to work for MHS Indiana, a Medicaid provider in my native Indianapolis. Having always had a passion for design, I began to research opportunities that would allow me to work in a healthy industry and put to use my skills and interests in design. I decided that the Web Design program at Startup Institute would allow me the opportunity to pursue a career of enjoyment and fulfillment.</p>
